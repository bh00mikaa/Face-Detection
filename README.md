# Face-Detection
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect human faces in images or video streams. It's a beginner-friendly implementation using Haar Cascade classifiers, ideal for learning basic computer vision concepts.

# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates a basic face detection system using Python and OpenCV. It uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to identify human faces in images or live video feed from a webcam.
